* Guile Asteroids (WIP)

Some fun with the [[https://dthompson.us/projects/chickadee.html][Chickadee]]. 

First install Chickadee + make sure everything is in your GUILE_LOAD_COMPILE_PATH then you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ guile main.scm
#+END_SRC

This also starts a REPL inside the game process/world, which you can connect to with Geiser in Emacs (geiser-connect).
